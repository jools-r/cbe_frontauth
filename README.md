# cbe_frontauth

This client-side plugin lets you and your users manage backend connections from the frontend, i.e. connect and disconnect as one would usually do from backend.

Use this to expose certain aspects and actions for logged in users only.

Further examples can be found on [Claire Brione's demonstration page](http://www.clairebrione.com/demo-cbe_frontauth) (in French).
